    <h2>Dear Babe kong Mahal na Mahal,</h2>

    <p>
      My Babe, I just wanted to take a moment to write you this letter and
      capture the beauty of what we're sharing right now. Life moves so
      fast—time never slows down, and every second feels shorter than a second.
      But through it all, there’s no one I’d rather be with than you. You make
      starting each day so much easier because I know I’ll get to talk to you,
      laugh with you, and share another piece of my life with you. As I go
      through my day, you’re the person I want to tell everything to—the good,
      the bad, the smallest details. Sharing life with you makes every happy
      moment even brighter and every difficult one easier to bear. You are my
      comfort, my safe place, my greatest joy. And at night, as I close my eyes,
      it’s your love that keeps me warm. The thought of you wraps around me like
      an embrace, making even the darkest nights feel safe and peaceful. With
      every passing day, I find myself loving you more. Time moves so quickly,
      but I know every second is worth it because I get to spend it with you. No
      matter what the future holds, I will always cherish these moments we have
      together. You are my greatest love, my heart’s truest home, and for as
      long as I can, I will treasure you with everything I am. Babe ko, you are
      important to me in ways I can’t even begin to describe. Thank you for
      being my partner, my best friend. I love you more than words can say, and
      I will always be here for you, no matter what. Thank you for caring for
      me, for loving me, for being my everything. I hope that you and I will
      stay together forever, growing old side by side, never parting ways.
      <br /><br />Forever yours, Kevin Wilson L. Lee <br /><br />
